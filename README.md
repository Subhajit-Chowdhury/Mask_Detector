# COVID-19-Face-Mask-Detector

Motivation :
In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. 
Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

Features :
Our face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. 
The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, it’s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).
This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

Dataset :
This dataset consists of 4095 images belonging to two classes:
with_mask: 2165 images
without_mask: 1930 images
